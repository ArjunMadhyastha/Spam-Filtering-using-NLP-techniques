# Spam-Filtering-using-NLP-techniques
This project implements a spam filtering system using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify SMS messages as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). The SMS Spam Collection dataset was used, containing a labeled set of SMS messages.

Key Features:
1. Dataset: SMS Spam Collection dataset, containing labels "spam" or "ham".
2. Preprocessing: NLTK was used for tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal to clean and prepare the text data.
3. Feature Extraction: Implemented the Bag of Words model to convert the SMS messages into a format suitable for machine 
   learning.
4. Machine Learning Model: A Naive Bayes classifier was used to predict whether a message is spam or ham.
5. Objective: The goal was to accurately filter spam messages, improving the performance of the classifier through effective 
   text preprocessing and model selection.
This project demonstrates a comprehensive workflow for text classification using NLP and machine learning techniques.
